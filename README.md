# Ruby on Rails Capstone Project: Contri_B

  - This is the capstone project of the Microverse Ruby on Rails curriculum.

  - In this project I created an contribution tracking app where users can create an account with their username and add contributions which can be grouped and ungrouped into the names of their choice.

  - Users can view contributions in each group.

  - Users can track the total amount of their contributions.


    Some of the advanced concepts explored in this project includes.

  - Basic Authentication using just username

  
  - Used RSpec as the test suite with the help of shoulda-matchers and capybara for effective testing. Unit, Functional and integration testing was done.
