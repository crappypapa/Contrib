# Ruby on Rails Capstone Project: Group your expenses

  - This is the capstone project of the Microverse Ruby on Rails curriculum. This capstone project is completed as part of the Microverse remote software developement curriculum using the pair programming approach.

  - In this project I created an expense log app where users can create an account with their username and add expenses which can be grouped and ungrouped into the names of their choice.

  - Users can also view each expenses in each group.

  - Users can track the total amount of their expenses.

  - This project is built with the MVP approach.

  Some of the advanced concepts explored in this project includes.
  - Working with advanced associations, many-to-many relationships.
  - Basic Authentication using just username
  - Used RSpec as the test suit with the help of shoulda-matchers and capybara for effective testing. Unit, Functional and integration testing was done.
